        <h2>In Case You Couldn't Read My Handwriting Earlier...</h2>
        <div class="letter">
          <p>Kaliyah,</p>
          
          <p>I just wanted to take a moment to write this because sometimes words are easier to express when they're written. I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way, but I felt like I needed to share what's been on my heart.</p>
          
          <p>I want to sincerely apologize for the ways I've hurt you. I know I've let you down more times than I care to admit, and the truth is, I carry that guilt with me every day. You trusted me, and I didn't live up to the person I should've been for you. That's on me, and I'll never stop striving to be better because of what I've learned from our time together.</p>
          
          <p>I understand now that you needed to put yourself first, and I respect you so much for having that strength. I want nothing more than for you to find peace and happiness in your life, no matter where it takes you.</p>
          
          <p>Even though we've been apart, I need you to know that my feelings for you haven't changed. I love you deeply, not in a way that demands anything from you, but in a way that makes me want the best for you—even if that's not with me. You've shown me what love is, and for that, I'll always be grateful.</p>
          
          <p>I hope life gives you everything you deserve, Kaliyah. You're an incredible person, and anyone would be lucky to have you in their life. I'll always cherish the memories we shared, and if someday you feel like there's room for us again, I'd be ready to start over and truly get it right. Until then, I'll keep you in my prayers and hold you close in my heart.</p>
